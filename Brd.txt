Business Requirement Document (BRD) – PlainID Access Control
1. Project Overview

The Case Management System (CMS) integrates with PlainID Policy Decision Point (PDP) to enforce access control. For every resource access request, CMS queries PlainID PDP.
PlainID PDP must return a decision: Permit or Deny based on defined rules.

2. Business Requirements
2.1 Functional Rules for Access Decisions
Rule 1 – Role-Based Access

Permit if the user role is Admin → Access to all cases.

Permit if the user role is Manager → Access to cases within their assigned department/region.

Deny if user role is Agent and case is marked as sensitive.

Deny if user role is not recognized (Guest, Unknown, etc.).

Rule 2 – Region-Based Access

Permit if user region matches the case region (e.g., EU user accessing EU case).

Deny if user region does not match case region (e.g., US user accessing EU case).

Rule 3 – Data Sensitivity

Permit if case is non-sensitive and user has valid role (Admin/Manager/Agent with correct region).

Deny if case is sensitive and user is not Admin.

Rule 4 – Time-Based Restriction

Permit if access request is within allowed working hours (08:00–20:00 local time).

Deny if access request is outside allowed hours.

Rule 5 – System Availability

Deny if PlainID PDP cannot evaluate due to system error or malformed request.

Deny if response time exceeds 200ms and retry also fails.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

PDP must return a decision (Permit/Deny) for every request.

All decisions must be logged for audit.

Latency per decision should be ≤200ms.
